Glasgow University MSc Project

The aim of this project is to understand whether multiplayer functionality in a game-based learning environment impacts the challenges and focus needed to increase student's learning outcomes. The project uses a local multiplayer system that allows students to challenge each otherâ€™s programming knowledge while the experiment uses a single and multiplayer mode to help understand the potential benefits of multiplayer game-based learning.
